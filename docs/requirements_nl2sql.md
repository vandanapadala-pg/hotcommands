# Comprehensive Requirements for NL2SQL Slash Command Framework

## 1. Design-Time Requirements
These requirements focus on the architecture, components, and configurations needed to design the system before deployment.

### 1.1. System Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Create a modular architecture with separate components for command parsing, NL2SQL processing, tool integration, context management, and response formatting.
- **Microservices or Monolith**: Decide whether to use a microservices architecture (e.g., separate services for NL2SQL engine, command registry, and tool integration) or a monolithic approach, based on scalability needs.
- **Extensibility**: Design a plugin system to allow developers to add new slash commands, domains, categories, and tool integrations without modifying core code.
- **Scalability**: Ensure the system can handle multiple concurrent users, databases, and external tool requests, with load balancing and caching mechanisms.
- **Cloud Compatibility**: Support deployment on multi-cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) with containerization (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).

### 1.2. Command Framework
- **Command Registry**: Implement a registry to store slash command metadata (name, domain, category, handler, description, required tools, permissions).
  - Storage: Use a database (e.g., PostgreSQL) or configuration files (e.g., JSON/YAML).
  - Example: `{ "command": "query", "domain": "RAN", "category": "Capacity", "handler": "handlers.ran_capacity.query", "required_tools": ["RAN_Analytics_API"] }`.
- **Command Parser**: Develop a parser to extract command name, arguments, and context from user input (e.g., regex `^/(\w+)(?:\s+(.+))?$`).
- **Dynamic Registration**: Provide an API or configuration interface to register new commands dynamically (e.g., `POST /api/register_command`).
- **Command Validation**: Ensure commands are validated for syntax, permissions, and domain/category compatibility before execution.

### 1.3. NL2SQL Engine
- **Natural Language Processing**: Integrate an NL2SQL model (e.g., based on LLMs like BERT, GPT, or custom-trained models) to translate natural language to SQL.
- **Schema Awareness**: Maintain domain/category-specific database schemas (e.g., `RAN/Capacity` tables: `cell_towers`, `bandwidth_usage`) to inform query generation.
  - Schema Storage: Use JSON/YAML files or a metadata database.
  - Example: `RAN/Capacity: { "tables": { "cell_towers": { "columns": { "cell_id": "int", "utilization": "float" } } } }`.
- **Query Optimization**: Include logic to optimize generated SQL (e.g., adding indexes, simplifying joins).
- **Error Handling**: Provide detailed error messages for invalid queries (e.g., “Table ‘orders’ not found in RAN/Capacity schema”).

### 1.4. Domain and Category Management
- **Context Switching**: Allow users to switch domains/categories via commands (e.g., `/set_domain RAN/Capacity`).
- **Metadata Management**: Store domain/category metadata (e.g., schemas, tools, permissions) in a centralized repository.
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Support nested domains/categories (e.g., `CustomerExperience/Mobility`) for granular query scoping.
- **Cross-Domain Support**: Enable commands to span multiple domains/categories if permitted (e.g., `/query` accessing both `RAN/Capacity` and `RAN/RF`).

### 1.5. Tool Integration
- **Tool Registry**: Maintain a registry of external tools (e.g., RAN analytics APIs, CX dashboards) with connection details (e.g., endpoint, auth method).
  - Example: `{ "tool": "RAN_Analytics_API", "endpoint": "https://ran.api/metrics", "auth": "api_key" }`.
- **API Compatibility**: Support REST APIs, gRPC, or SDKs for tool integrations.
- **Tool Abstraction**: Create an abstraction layer to standardize tool interactions (e.g., a common interface for querying RAN or CX tools).
- **Caching**: Implement caching for tool responses to reduce latency and API rate limit issues.

### 1.6. User Interface
- **Chat Interface**: Design a responsive chat UI (e.g., web-based using React or a native app) supporting slash commands and formatted outputs (tables, charts, JSON).
- **Output Formatting**: Support multiple output formats (e.g., table, CSV, JSON) with a default set via `/format`.
- **Visualization**: Integrate a charting library (e.g., Chart.js) for commands like `/chart` to display data visually (e.g., bar, line, pie charts).
- **Interactive Elements**: Allow users to interact with results (e.g., expandable tables, downloadable CSVs).

### 1.7. Security and Access Control
- **Authentication**: Support user authentication (e.g., OAuth2, API keys) for access to the MCP server.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Define roles (e.g., `RAN_admin`, `CX_analyst`) with permissions per domain/category.
  - Example: `RAN_admin` can run `/optimize_cell`, but `CX_analyst` cannot.
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Sanitize inputs to prevent SQL injection in `/run` or NL2SQL queries.
- **Audit Logging**: Log all commands, queries, and tool interactions for auditing and debugging.

### 1.8. Database Support
- **Multi-Database Compatibility**: Support common databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, Snowflake) for NL2SQL queries.
- **Connection Management**: Allow dynamic connection switching via `/connect [database_name]`.
- **Schema Discovery**: Automatically fetch or cache database schemas for NL2SQL processing.

### 1.9. Development and Testing
- **Programming Language**: Choose a language for the backend (e.g., Python for NL2SQL, Node.js for UI, Go for performance).
- **Testing Framework**: Implement unit tests (e.g., pytest for Python) for command handlers, NL2SQL translations, and tool integrations.
- **Mock Tools**: Create mock APIs for testing tool integrations (e.g., RAN_Analytics_API simulator).
- **Documentation**: Provide developer documentation for adding commands, domains, and tools, including API specs and schema formats.

### 1.10. Deployment
- **Containerization**: Package the system in Docker containers for multi-cloud deployment.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up a pipeline (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions) for automated testing and deployment.
- **Configuration Management**: Use environment variables or config files for database credentials, tool endpoints, and API keys.

## 2. Run-Time Requirements
These requirements ensure the system operates efficiently, securely, and reliably during execution.

### 2.1. Command Execution
